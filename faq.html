                    <p><b>F</b>requently <b>A</b>sked <b>Q</b>uestions for CollabVM.</p>

                    <h3>Q. What is CollabVM?</h3>
                    <p>CollabVM is a website where you can control a computer (virtual machine) from your web browser with strangers. Everybody can click on the screen and request an 18 second turn.</p>

                    <h3>Q. How do I use it?</h3>
                    <p>Select a machine from the home page, then click on the screen and wait for your turn. If you are waiting for a turn, a counter will be shown on the bottom of the display, showing how much longer you'll have to wait. If nobody has a turn, you'll be given one immediately.</p>

                    <h3>Q. The machine is destroyed, really slow, or won't boot up anymore, what do I do?</h3>
                    <p>If the machine does not start or is destroyed, you should click the "Vote for Reset" button which will start a reset to restore the machine to a clean state. If the Vote Reset button is not there or it isn't working, please contact the admins on our Discord or via e-mail (link below)</p>

                    <h3>Q. Some names have a blue/yellow background, what does that mean?</h3>
                    <p>If a user has a blue background, that means they have a turn. If they have a yellow one, they are in the queue and are waiting for one. If they don't have one, they aren't taking or waiting for a turn</p>

                    <h3>Q. I get a message saying the VMs couldn't be loaded, what can I do?</h3>
                    <p>First, please make sure you have JavaScript enabled and don't have the following extensions enabled:
                      - NoScript
                      - uMatrix
                      - Ghostery (known to affect certain users)
                      If you have them installed, make an exception for CollabVM and refresh.
                      If you are using Tor, a VPN, or a proxy, CollabVM has these blocked to prevent abuse. Try turning them off and try again.</p>

                    <h3>Q. There's a login screen, what's the password?</h3>
                    <p>The Windows machines do not have a password. If there is one, somebody else put it there. Start a vote reset if you can't login.
                      The Linux machine (VM 3) does have a login screen. The "dartz" user does not have a password, while "user"s password is "user" (without quotes).</p>

                    <h3>Q. How can I contact the admins?</h3>
                    <p>The fastest and easiest way to contact the admins is to join our Discord server and DM or ping one of them.

                      Alternatively, you may contact us at changethis@mail.address. </p>

                    <h3>Q. Some names are red or green, what does it mean?</h3>
                    <p>A user with a red name is an Administrator, while a user with a green name is a Moderator. A standard user does not have any color.</p>

                    <h3>Q. Somebody's breaking the rules! How can I report them?</h3>
                    <p>Please e-mail us or join our Discord if you would like to report somebody who is breaking the rule</p>

                    <h3>Q. The keyboard is not accepting input or is opening shortcuts!</h3>
                    <p>Take a turn, and when you have a turn, press the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys. This should unstick the keys.</p>

                    <h3>Q. Can I run viruses?</h3>
                    <p>You can run whatever programs you want, including viruses, trojans, etc, as long as it doesn't break any of our rules.</p>
